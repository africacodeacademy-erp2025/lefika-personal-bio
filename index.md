## Journey
### Early Life
Born and raised in Botswana, I am an adventurous, explorative and curious individual. Always looking to discover something new and hidden about the world and myself. Grew fond of IT and the world of creative arts at an early age, and later on explored life as a software engineer during my university years. Made numerous oil and acrylic landscape paintings, and later on got into taking wildlife/geographical photographs as a supplement for my love for art. A natural athlete, ranging from football and track athlete.  

### Education and Career
### University
Completed my BSc(Hons) Computer Systems Engineering degree at Botswana Accountancy College from 2021 to 2025. A very hands-on course that has allowed me to get in tune with System Administration, Programming, Database Management, Cybersecurity, a foundation on Artificial Intelligence and an industrial attachment. Acquired a Cisco CCNAv7 Networking certificate as my foundational course in Networking. Pursuing a Software Developer career, with aspirations of being a full-fledged Cloud Engineer in future.

### Additional Accomplishments
Constantly taking part in Cloud and Cybersecurity based programs such as AWS Cloud Practitioner, OCI Foundations, IoT and Digital Transformations, and Cisco Virtual Events. Acquired my JavaScript Essentials certification from Cisco to further my knowledge and expertise as a software developer.

### Goals
I have acquired what one would call _surface level foundation_ or the skills needed to be a software developer. I seek to go beyond what I've attained from my growth and experience from university, learn new tools, master programming languages and grasp a stronger understanding of what it is to be a Software Developer. Africa Code Academy is the right place to start for me.

## Projects
### Project 1
_Restaurant Management System_
<br> A mobile application built using XML, Java and Firebase integration for data storage. This project focused on developing an application that served as a recipe management platform that people can use to input their desired recipe, edit recipes, delete recipes, pin a location from the application and make online payments when making orders. This project tested my mobile application skills, both frontend and backend development. 

### Project 2
_Phishing Email Detection_
<br> An AI-focused project, developed using programming languages such as Python, and tools like TensorFlow. As someone who has studied cybersecurity, this project tested my security expertise, considering the vulnerabilities and cyber attacks that most people face when using internet based platforms. Emails are amongst the commonly used methods by cyber attackers, looking to get personal credintials from users and use them for illegal activeties. This project was to address that matter. A system that serves as your protector from cyber attacks like phishing, preventing users from giving away valuable information.

### Project 3
_AI Solutions_
<br> A web-based project from the Product Development module. Unlike other projects, this one consists of a client that a developer is working for, planned meetings and real time updates of the software being built. This project gave me a much clearer understanding of what a software developer will be doing, having a client to pitch in an idea/product they have in mind, getting numerous feedbacks on the product, frequent documentations and methodologies. The website was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Firebase and additional APIs for certain features in the website such as the AI chatbot.
